You will also dig deeper by 'training' a linear regression model manually in a few different ways. \n\nYou might be wondering, \"*why all the excitement about linear regression?*\"  It so happens that regression is one of the workhorses of machine learning, and it also underlies other more complex types of models.  The advantage of regression models is that they are highly interpretable and very stable when it comes to training/fitting. In fact, linear regression models, particularly multiple linear regression with many input predictors, can mimic a lot of the power of more complex models, such as neural networks, while maintaining their computational stability and interpretability. There is a long running joke/meme about companies that claim to use \"machine learning\" actually use linear regression (and logistic regression, which we'll soon see more of). This isn't entirely a joke though since even if a company is using very powerful/complex types of models (e.g. deep neural networks), they will almost always have already tried using a linear regression model because it would be the cheaper and faster solution.  In other words, linear regression is almost always the default modeling approach, and is sometimes hard to beat!\n\nYou can open this notebook in either Google Colab:\n\n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sgeinitz/CS3120/blob/main/lab01_linear_regression.ipynb)\n\nor in Kaggle:\n\n[![Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg)](https://kaggle.com/kernels/welcome?src=https://github.com/sgeinitz/CS3120/blob/main/lab01_linear_regression.ipynb)\n\nBe sure when submitting your assignment that you have saved the notebook back to a GitHub repository or Gist, and that your notebook has\n* __all output shown from code cells__, and\n* __all questions answered clearly__. \n\n*Note that this notebook uses some content from a [course at NYU](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/courses/labincp/labs/LabReg-IntroToRegression.html), which itself borrowed content from [General Assembly's Data Science](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT4) course, which claims to have adapted materials from one of the most authoritative texts on the subject, [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).*\n\n***\n\nWhen using a Jupyter notebook you would typically load all the Python libraries/modules that you'll use right away.

We change the connections of the weights (or parameters) inside our brains to help us better predict our environment.  For instance if your roommate is prone to late night partying and being grumpy the next day you might mentally fit a model to the experiences you have and \"learn\" what features are predictive of them being grumpy.  So basically fitting a linear regression model is the same as doing basic machine learning!

Let's go ahead and confirm that the manual approaches we've seen, and the intuition behind them also make sense. \n\nMost often we'll see a linear regression defined for one $i^{th}$ observation or training example. Which, for the feature $x_i$ and outcome $y_i$, is written as:\n$$y_i = \\beta_0 1 + \\beta_1 x_i$$\n\nHowever, we also saw that this can be written in vector or matrix notation where the matrix, $X$, has a column of 1's in it.\n$$\\vec{y} = X \\vec{\\beta}$$\nwhere\n$$\\vec{\\beta} = \\begin{bmatrix}\\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1\\end{bmatrix}$$\nThen, since (or if) the columns of the matrix $X$ are linearly independent, then the matrix $(X^T X)$ has an inverse, and the model parameters can be calculated directly using:\n$$\\vec{\\beta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T \\vec{y}$$\n\nLet's now confirm this works using the parenthood data.

It is not super important that you know this, but it's a fun alternative way to see how linear regression models are fit to their data. \n\nThe more intuitive way to explain how we fit a linear regression model is by looking more precisely at that quantity we want to minimize, namely the SSE:\n$$\\text{SSE} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$$\n\nRecall that since $\\hat{y}_i$ is the prediction for the $i^{th}$ observation, we can write it as $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i$, and thus rewrite SSE as:\n$$\\text{SSE} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i)\\right)^2$$\n\nSince there are two parameters, $\\beta_0, \\beta_1$, it's easy for us to visualize what the SSE looks like as a function of these two parameters.
